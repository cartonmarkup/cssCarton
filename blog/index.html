          <p>The first time I thought I had written something great I went to my father to approve – He didn’t. I still hear
            him saying <strong>„Who would want to read that“</strong>. To be honest I don’t remember what it was he should read, but for sure
            he was right about the quality. As kids our parents always treated us like adults. Punching us their opinion
            unfiltered in our face wasn’t meant to hurt. They thought it would be the best way to enable us to improve. They
            frustrated me allot. From the perspective of an sensitive boy it felt kind of harsh to be rated this way. Today,
            I think without intension they implanted the <a href="dna">DNA</a> of an designer inside my personality.</p>
          <p>Designing like every creative process needs honesty and the power of endurance. A great designer is able to take
            stick and transform it into improvement. He should be his hardest critic himself. Every aspect of his work must
            keep up the criticism or has to be improved in another iteration to get one step closer to perfection. Perfection
            is meant to be as the best result the designer can archive, based on his current talents, experience and the
            given circumstances. The output a designer generates always represents the strength of his personality, his intelligence,
            taste and of course that he cares. He must ban his insecurity and find his own balance between excitement and
            frustration, details and entirety, exploration and organization, time and claim, to get satisfaction based on
            his output. </p>
